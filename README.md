<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project was to recreate you're favorite website using .html, .CSS, BootStrap, and JavaScript. I was asked to create a responsive navbar/hamburger menu using CSS styling.
After creating that I then put a banner with the websites heading underneath and wrapped it in a container-fluid div class.
I wanted to showcase some of the companies that are involved with the website so I created cards with images and a text body I styled them with CSS displaying them with inline-block.
Below that i created an auto playing carousel using bootstrap for featured images and wrapped it in aa container-fluid div class.
The video was embeded from Youtube using the iframe function and wrapped into a container-fluid div class.
Then at the bottom of the page is the footer with the name of the project and the year of the copyright, (which in the future I plan to make it auto update).

The main section of the about page tells the users what the website is all about cars, cars, cars!!
My pride and joy of this entire project is the countdown clock which users can put in the date of an upcoming event and watch the time tick down to event day, it took longer than i want to admit and a lot of research to get this to work right.
Below that I created a table to list upcoming events and used html and CSS to style it with striped rows and a hover effect.
I then embeded maps from google maps to show the location of the events which are interactive and users can get directions directly from the map.

The contact page is just that its the place where users can contact the website about questions, concerns, comments, or to submit a picture to possibly be featured on the page.
when the user presses the submit button a pop up window shows up letting the user that the message has been sent.

I really enjoyed this project and plan to work on it some more in the future. I had some ups and downs almost feeling defeated but im glad I stuck with it.
